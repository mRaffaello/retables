## Motivations

There are already countless libraries built to handle tables with React. So why creating a new one?
**reTables** started out as an internal project to meet the needs of a small development team and was later made public.

The initial goals were to develop a library with this charateristics:

-   Extremely **lightweight**
-   Uncompromising **customization**
-   **Minimizing** component re-renders (more on this later)

Despite the many alternatives on the market, none of those managed to satisfy us completely. In many cases you are forced to import large bundles just to render a simple table, in others you need to override pre-packaged style sheets. There are also interesting "headless" proposals which guarantee maximum customization possibilities but force you to write a lot of boilerplate code to get started.

**reTables** wants to act as an in-between solution. It is able to offer a nearly complete customization, with just a few lines of code.
