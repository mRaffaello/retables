# Quick start

**reTables** wants to minimize the code needed to render a table. All you need to get started is:

-   [**Array of data**](/examples-context#the-people-array) you want to display and its type (if you are using Typescript)
-   [**Unique data key**](#data-key) for every item in the array
-   Basic [**column configuration**](#column-config)

:::note

The following examples use the _people array_ presented early in the [doc](/examples-context#the-people-array).
:::

## Core concepts

Let's start by looking at the core concepts of **reTables**.

### Data key

When rendering a table, **reTables** needs an internal key to identify uniquely every object in the array. Generally this key is `id` but you can specify any property, even the nested ones.

In the people example you can use `id` or other values, as your `dataKey`, such as `contacts.phone` or `about.job`.

:::caution

Make sure that all the objects in the array have an unique `dataKey` value. Duplicated entries can cause problems during sorting or pagination.

:::

### NestedKeyOf type

Many props, like the previous `dataKey` example, use `NestedKeyOf` as a type. This is basically a glorified `keyof`, which allows you to access nested properties in a dotted notation.
Here is the list of the inferred values for `People`.

```jsx
import Person from 'src/types';
import { NestedKeyOf } from 'retables';

type PersonKeys = NestedKeyOf<Person>;
// type PersonKeys = "id" | "company" | "about.firstName" | "about.lastName" | "about.job" | "about.age" | "contacts.address" | "contacts.phone"
```

:::info

Arrays, dates and optional properties are excluded from `NestedKeyOf<T>`.
In some occasions, like the columns configuration, **reTables** uses `NestedKeyOfWithOptionals<T>` type which allows optional properties.
:::

### Column config

Every table needs its **column config**. This is an object that describes which columns need to be displayed and how to retrieve data for each of it.

```ts file=../src/examples/quick-start/columns.ts

```

A basic column config needs:

-   **title** (`string`): Column name that will be displayed in the header
-   **key** (`NestedKeyOfWithOptionals<T>`): Object key that selects the property. (This will also effect sorting)

As shown above, you can also specify a **flex property **(defaults to 1) that indicates the horizontal weight of each column.
A complete list of the API can be found [here](/api-reference).

### Breakpoints

Some of the table props can be personalized, based on the current width of the screen.

By default, below the `BREAKPOINT.MD`, the mobile version of the table will automatically be displayed.

<BrowserOnly>{() => <BreakpointsTable />}</BrowserOnly>
<br />

:::info

The `BREAKPOINT` enum is directly exported from **reTables**.

:::

## Your first table

This is all you need to do in **reTables** to render minimal sortable and responsive table.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="QuickStartTable.tsx">
```

```tsx file=../src/examples/quick-start/QuickStartTable.tsx#L6-L25

```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="columns.ts">
```

```ts file=../src/examples/quick-start/columns.ts

```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Live example">
```

<BrowserOnly>{() => <QuickStartTable />}</BrowserOnly>

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::info

All the tables on the documentation site are rendered using **reTables**. Head over to the `Live example` tab to see the result!

:::
:::note

Note that here we have also applied to the **header** some personalization, using `baseHeadersClasses` and `baseCellPadding`. More of these options will be explained in the [next section](/basic-personalization).
